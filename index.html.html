<h1> GTR GODZILLA </h1> </font>
<p> <fontcolor="black" size="50">All around, the GTR is the perfect sports car. The Nissan GTR is the perfect price. It is approximately 1/3 cheaper than any other sports car in its class.
The GTR’s competitors contain Ferrari, SRT, BMW, Porsche, Aston Martin, McLaren,Lamborghini as well as Bugatti.
All of these high-end, respected, sports car companies and their cars are ranged from well over 100 grand, if not in the millions.
Amazingly, the GTR is right around 80 grand, which is a tremendous difference in price. With all the extra money you could save,
you could make your GTR one of a kind. If customizing or tuning isn’t your mind set, the GTR is still one of the best, 
affordable sports cars which makes more people love them. Performance wise, the GTR is one of the fastest sports cars.</p>

<p>It can reach 0-60 mph in less than 3 seconds, making it one of the fastest production cars in the world.It contains a 3.8 liter twin turbo V6 engine
 with an output of 545 hp and 463 lbs of torque (CarBuzz). The GTR not only packs a punch with the engine, but technology wise 
it contains viscous launch control, AWD, a dual matted clutch transmission with sequential paddle shifting and much more updated tuning.
Launch control is a setting you can turn on that sets the GTR’s RPM’s perfectly to ensure the best possible take off. 
Sequential paddle shifting is part of a semi-automatic transmission that involves manual shifting without the use of a clutch, 
which is the foot pedal that shifts the power from the engine to the transmission.The dual-matted clutch transmission means that it has two clutches,
 one for the even gears and one for the odd gears. The reason for this is a constant acceleration through the gears.</p> </font>
